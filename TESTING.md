## Validation

### HTML Validation

The W3C Markup Validator was used to validate some of the tutorial templates similar to the Boutique Ado project. There was a warning to suggests that the type attribute specified in the script tag was unnecessary for JavaScript resources on some of the pages.
I tested all custom templates - the blog templates, the subscribe template and the stockists template. They all had no errors, except for the stockists template. I updated a closing tag missing and checked for others although the validator did not recognise my updates to the file. I checked using direct input instead and the only errors were related to the Django syntax and not the html.

### CSS Validation

The W3C CSS Validator was used to validate the base.css file which showed no errors.

### JavaScript Validation

The JSHint validation service was used to used to validate JavaScript used for Stripe functionality in the project. There were 2 warnings related to the ES6 version of JavaScript

-   [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/) - [Results](media/jsvalidation.png)

### Python Validation

The Code Institute Python Linter was used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. I amended any errors for example: syntax and line breaks - the remaining errors are related to lines of code being too long in some files. However, I wanted to preserve clarity and readability of the code, so I left the code as it is.

### Lighthouse Report

I used Lighthouse to audit the site to evaluate performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices - accessibility scores were slightly reduced due to heading elements not in a sequentially-descending order, and buttons could have a more accessible name for screen readers, which would be a consideration for future template development.

### Responsive and Browser Testing

As well as validating all html, css, js & python files, I have checked compatibilities across a selection of browsers and devices.

### Transactional Email

I tested to make sure users receive an email at registration to verify their account and also an email containing their order details following purchase.

### Testing User Stories

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main products sold by the ecommerce company

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Shop Now" Call to action button.
        2. The main visual impression of the brand is evident immediately with the hero image.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find products.

        1. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link has a dropdown menu which describes what category they will end up at clearly, alternatively the left hand dropdown menu offers a selection of sort methods.
        2. Users can click on a product of interest to find out more about the product and add their chosen quantity to their basket.
        <img src="media/individual_product_page.png">
        3. There is a Keep Shopping call to action button at the bottom of each product page to return the customer to the main product page.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for reviews to understand what their customers think of them and see if they are trusted and provide a good level of service. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has visited individual products, the user will be able to see reviews indicating what previous buyers thought about the product.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of most pages on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to explore and find new and inspiring dried fruit and nuts to buy.

        1. These are clearly shown in the product layouts and individual product pages.
        2. Shoppers will be able to find out about new products when they are anounced in the blog.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to buy products form the store and get them delivered.

        1. The individual product pages allow users to add products to their bag.
        2. A toast message will appear to inform the user they have successfully added the product quantity to the bag.
        <img src="media/toast_msg1.png">
        3. Users can see products listed on the shopping bag page with a total cost information on delivery threshold and a button to click through to the checkout page to purchase.
        4. Users can create an account and buy products for delivery using card payment methods.
        5. The user receives a toast message to confirm if the purchase was successful and the user will receive a confirmation emai to their email address.

        1. The Blog Page has a tab on the main navigtion and will open the main blog archive with a list of posts to read. Each post links through to the complete article on a new page.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to find products easily through search options.

        1. The user can explore the sort methods in the drop down menu on the main navigation and sort products by price rating or category. Each sort optioin has further options such as ordering products from low - high price or alphabetically for example.
        <img src="media/category_selection.png">
    2. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up and create my own account.

        1. Users can set up an account at any time. This would be more relevant to users who buy often and like the speed and convenience of ordering whilst logged into their account. They can also keep a record of past users and their delivery details are autosaved.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed information about any new products.
        1. Via the main navigation users can visit the page with a newsletter sign-up form.
        2. The user can see a form with a name and email field with associated text enticing the user to sign up and the benefits they will recieve by doing so. 
        3. There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input fields which can easily be distinguished.

-   #### Site Owner Goals

    1. As a Site Owner, I want the website to be attractive to customers and entice them to buy products easily.
        1. The home page displays a structured navigation with sotrting and filtering functionality, enabling shoppers to find products easily.
        2. Product pages display an image and a clear desription of the product which can be easily added to a basket which is displayed in a modal to the top right of the page. 

    2. As a Site Owner, I want to establish a reular customer base who return and make regular purchases.
        1. Customers can create their own account through the sign-up page and save their details. They can also see a list of previous purchases within the account layout
        2. The blog informs customers to recently added products and nutritional benefits of products.

    3. As a Site Owner, I want products to be stocked in high street shops and keep track of stock held by partners.
        1. The stockists app lists high street vendors who stock the Nutritionist's products.
        <img src="media/stockists-list.png">
        2. The shop owner/superuser can update the list manually in the admin area to indicate whether a partner has products or is out of stock. Future development would see this functionality to be developed to indicate what products are in stock and eventually into an automated inventory system.

### Solved Bugs
- I had two paths for the Subscribe App. The path in the Subscribe app urls.py should have been empty rather entered as 'subscribe' , the result being two paths to the Nutritionist urls.py file and one of them could not be identified by Django causing an error.

<img src="media/error-example.png">

<img src="media/error-subscribe.png">

- Email authentication suddenly stopped working after a few weeks for new users registering an account on the site. I checked using Django error page which indicated it was a Google issue. I had to add a new password for access to email authentication via the Django app as Google had deleted the previous one.

### Known Bugs
- When a user signs up for a newsletter and already has placed items in the bag - the Success message correctly states a successful signup but appears with contents of bag in the modal - user experience would be improved if the success message didn't include bag products. 

- Manual testing revealed that users registering a new profile receive an incorrectly formatted email. This will be ammended in Google account settings.
